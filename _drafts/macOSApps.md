# Apple macOS (aka OS X)

I use a lot of applications on our macs. Here is a list of the ones that I love and use the most of my day to day life, sorted by their importance: 

1. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) 
 - this is by far my favourite application that I have. It saved me [a lot of time](http://i.imgur.com/eavekiX.png) in my life and has a really great [community](http://www.alfredforum.com/) and [very powerful workflows](http://www.packal.org/) that you can use
 - I have attached the ones I use the most to [this repo](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows) 
 - feel free to use any that you like

2. [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) 
 - recently moved completely to using the command line for all my development needs, this is probably the best terminal emulator out there that exists, have it assigned to [w + j](https://my.mindnode.com/c7EmmKvaxCyCEuTzcpkGB4MGeLpWdR8nsJK4rjDh) and can open it on demand at any time that I want
 - [here](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/3fbe13ce427132d0297f411b62f49034) are all the [homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html) packages I like and use 
 - I also really love using [this workflow](https://github.com/isometry/alfred-tty) to quickly [switch between iTerm tabs](http://i.imgur.com/RNLb5wj.png)

3. [1Password](https://1password.com) 
 - my password manager of choice, recently started to generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by my one master password
 - no longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilist activating two factor authentication wherever possible

4. [Dictionary](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dictionary_(software))
 - comes natively with macOS and I started to love using it for exploring and searching through wikipedia
 - it is incredibly fast to make the searches and it also gives [quick autosuggestions](http://i.imgur.com/BPOmjkZ.png) for any query I type that I can then select with up and down arrows

5. [Transmit](https://www.panic.com/transmit/)
 - I often use this app to quickly send files from my local file system to the cloud (either S3 or dropbox) and get a shareable link I can send to people
 - I use [this alfred workflow](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6y1lwy7lq9njdv6/Transmit.alfredworkflow?dl=1) to [quickly open](http://i.imgur.com/RkkcdvA.png) the cloud storage I need

6. [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) 
 - a torrent client that I use, very minimal in its UI but is very powerful and has all the features that I need without the bloat that [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/intl/en/) and other clients have
 - have all my torrents downloaded into their specific folders
 - I also want to set up a seedbox with my raspberry pie in the future as I have a bad tendency of not seeding the torrents that I downloaded

7. [Acorn](http://www..com/acorn/) 
 - probably the best image editor out there on Mac, is packed with very powerful features and is very simple in its UI

# Browser

My browser of choice is [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/). Chrome just kills the battery and Safari is really well optimised for macOS plus I have tried both and I really do find Safari a lot more 'snappier' to use. One powerful plus that chrome does have over safari is the amount of chrome extensions that you can get. Fortunately the ones most needed for me do exist on Safari. 

Extensions: 

1. Push to Kindle
2. 1Password
3. [Synology Download Station extension](https://www.download-station-extension.com/?utm_source=extension&utm_medium=Chrome&utm_campaign=settings) 

# Command Line Apps

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a really wonderful and user friendly package manager for macOS. 

[Here](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/3fbe13ce427132d0297f411b62f49034) are all the packages I use from it. 

And here are some more command line tools I use and love : 

- [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) : corrects your previous console command
- [ccat](https://github.com/jingweno/ccat) : [cat](http://www.linfo.org/cat.html) command with colours


# Alfred Workflows

I find [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) with its ability to create custom workflows for it to bring me the most value. 

I keep a list of my favourite workflows and why I love them in a GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows). Feel free to contribute to it if you wish.
