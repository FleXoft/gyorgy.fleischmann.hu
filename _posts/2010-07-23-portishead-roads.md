<p><strong>Portishead: Roads</strong></p>
<p>Oh, can't anybody see,<br />
We've got a war to fight,<br />
Never found our way,<br />
Regardless of what they say.</p>
<p>How can it feel, this wrong,<br />
From this moment,<br />
How can it feel, this wrong.</p>
<p>Storm,<br />
In the morning light,<br />
I feel,<br />
No more can I say,<br />
Frozen to myself.</p>
<p>I got nobody on my side,<br />
And surely that ain't right,<br />
Surely that ain't right.</p>
<p>Oh, can't anybody see,<br />
We've got a war to fight,<br />
Never found our way,<br />
Regardless of what they say.</p>
<p>How can it feel, this wrong,<br />
From this moment,<br />
How can it feel, this wrong.</p>
<p>How can it feel this wrong,<br />
From this moment,<br />
How can it feel, this wrong.</p>
<p>Oh, can't anybody see,<br />
We've got a war to fight,<br />
Never found our way,<br />
Regardless of what they say.</p>
<p>How can it feel, this wrong,<br />
From this moment,<br />
How can it feel, this wrong.</p>
