So many things we have
Why don't you stay with me tonight?
I'm trying to discover you
Together again for all the night
There's something going on right now
Feelin' happy
Feel the moon
Let's get closer baby
'cause we're dance and dance

All my friends are talking to me
What's this love I see
I know you can make it right
I'm still waiting now
Waiting for the love I need
If you want me too 
There's something don't understand
I don't know
