<strong>Introduction</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_1">0:00</a>)

<strong>Talk Talk</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_2">0:30</a>)

What did I tell you before when I was up?
Anxiety was bringing me down
I'm tired of listening to you, talking in rhymes
Twisting round to make me think
You're straight down the line

All you do to me is talk talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk
All you do to me is talk talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk
All you do to me is talk talk

If every sign that I see is complete
Then I'm a fool in your game
And all you want to do is tell me your lies
Won't show the other side
You're just wasting my time

All you do to me is talk talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk
All you do to me is talk talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk
All you do to me is talk talk

When every choice that I make is yours
Keep telling me what's right and what's wrong
Don't you ever stop to think about me
I'm not that blind to see
That you've been cheating on me

And hear you laugh at me when I'm up
I see you when you were crying for me when I'm down
I see you when you laugh at me when I'm up
I see you when you were crying for me

All you do to me is talk talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk
All you do to me is talk talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk

<strong>Dum Dum Girl</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_3">3:50</a>) 

Dum, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl

Another sigh with no regret
More coins inside her hands
One time to learn respect
Now mercenary she stands

I'm no boy
Stealing pennies from the poor
Break it down
Can't you see she's

Dum, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl

Another hand upon her hair
Time probably erased
Distaste and so she's left
Where guilt is out of place

I'm no boy
Stealing pennies from the poor
Break it down
Can't you see she's

Dum, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl

I'm no boy
Stealing pennies from the poor
Break it down
Can't you see she's

Dum, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl
The dum dum girl, the dum dum girl

<strong>Call in the Night Boy</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_4">7:28</a>) 

Say goodnight
Every hour brings the morning of my life
Out of time
Every step I take I'm further down the line

Here I stand left behind
My eyes open wide
If you need me you should try

Calling the night boy
Calling
Calling the night boy

Say goodnight
Every hour brings the morning of my life
Out of tune
Every breath I take, I take it over you

I don't care what people say
I don't care if night is day
I'll remember if you say

Calling the night boy
Calling
Calling the night boy
Calling

Here I stand left behind
My eyes are open wide
If you need me you should try

Calling the night boy
Calling
Calling the night boy
Calling

Calling the night boy
Calling the night boy

Calling the night boy
Calling
Calling the night boy
Calling

<strong>Tomorrow Started</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_5">14:24</a>) 

Don't look back until you try
A line so openly a lie
Outside of you
It's just tomorrow starting

I've said I'm wrong when I've been right
I've seen times when I've been sure
But still I find, I'm just the first that you take
Are there reasons everybody pays?

They never seem to be any use
They never seem to be any use
It's just tomorrow starting

Don't look back until you've tried
With time you'll endlessly arrive
Outside of use
With just tomorrow starting

See my eyes
Tell me I'm not lying
I'm just the first that you take
Are there reasons everybody pays?

They never seem to be any use
They never seem to be any use
It's just tomorrow starting

See my eyes
Tell me I'm not lying
I'm just the first that you take
Are there reasons everybody pays?

They never seem to be any use
They never seem to be any use
They never seem to be any use
It's just tomorrow starting

<strong>My Foolish Friend</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_6">22:04</a>)

Lay your hands into my head
I've been rude
I don't care what you do

So much heart is not enough
I've seen few
Who treat me like you do

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
Upon this weary line

My foolish friend
Don't tell me if I'm right

Teenage tears the saving grace
Of this fool
But no-one's watching you

Save this mirror for your face
There are two
No matter what you choose

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
Upon this weary line

My foolish friend
Don't tell me if I'm right
When I can really rebel
Yes, I'm really saddened

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life
Upon this weary line

My foolish friend
Don't try to live my life

<strong>Life's What You Make It</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_7">26:48</a>)

Baby, life's what you make it
Can't escape it
Baby, yesterday's favourite
Don't you hate it

Jesus loves all life
Life's what you make it
Jesus loves all life

Baby, life's what you make it
Don't back date it
Baby, don't try to shade it
Beauty is naked

Everything's all right
Life's what you make it
Everything's all right
Life's what you make it

Baby, life's what you make it
Celebrate it
Anticipate it
Yesterday's faded
Nothing can change it
Life's what you make it

Everything's all right
Life's what you make it
Everything's all right
Life's what you make it

Everything's all right
Yeah yeah
Everything's all right
[incomprehensible]
Everything's all right
Life's what you make it

<strong>Does Caroline Know</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_8">31:28</a>)

Maybe when the heat's away you're fine
To put another drink away is out of line, out of line

So easy with a thief to blame, for breaking every pledge I've made
Does it matter if I can't say, Caroline knows

Every little accident takes time
Forget about mistakes I've made they're left behind, left behind

So easy with a thief to blame, for breaking every pledge I've made
Does it matter if I can't say, Caroline knows, Caroline knows

So easy with a thief to blame, for breaking every pledge I've made
Does it matter if I can't say, does it matter if I can't say, Caroline knows

<strong>It's You</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_9">39:36</a>)

Say it again
Heart of stone
Red on your face
So alone
Say it again
And I'll know it's you
God only knows

Why do lies about this girl bother you?
Time is waiting to explain, why refuse?
It's you

Say it again
Heart of sand
Tears on your face
'Nothing stands'
God only knows
I've noticed you
Say it again

Why do lies about this girl bother you?
Time is waiting to explain, why refuse?
It's you

Say it again
I know it's you
God only knows

Why do lies about this girl bother you?
Time is waiting to explain, why refuse?
It's you

Talk in rhymes about the world watching you
It's you
So unwise about the girl

It's you
Why do lies about the girl bother you?
It's you
Tired of waiting to explain

<strong>Living in Another World</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_10">43:41</a>)

Better parted
I see people crying
Truth gets harder
There's no sense in lying

Help me
Find my way from this maze
I can't help myself

When I see tenderness before you left
(Forget)
That even breaking up was never meant
(Forget)
But only angels look before they tread
(Forget)

(Living in another world to you)
(Living in another world to you)
(Living in another world to you)

Better parted
I see people hiding
Speech gets harder
There's no sense in writing

Help me
Find the way from this maze
I can't help myself

When I see tenderness before you left
(Forget)
That even breaking up was never meant
(Forget)
But only angels look before they tread
(Forget)

(Living in another world to you)
(Living in another world to you)
(Living in another world to you)

Help me
Find a way from this maze
I'm living in another world to you
And I can't help myself

Did I see tenderness where you saw hell?
(Forget)
Did I see angels in the hand I held?
(Forget)
God only knows what kind of tale you'd tell
(Forget)

(Living in another world to you)
(Living in another world to you)
(Living in another world to you)

<strong>Give It Up</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_11">51:31</a>) 

From the place that I stand
To the land that is openly free
Watching rivers run black
By the trees that are vacant to greed

Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance
Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance
And the jokes just started

Gotta give it up
Give it up,
Give it up
Gotta give it up

Or tell me why I'm so wrong
Where does love come from
If you've sold your reasoning out

How can I learn
If I don't understand what I see
If I'm giving this mess
Take a walk through a nightmare so real

Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance
Gotta give it up
Gotta get a second chance
And the jokes just started

Gotta give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Gotta give it up

Or tell me why I'm so wrong
Where does luck come from
When you've never been without

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Gotta give it up

Give it up
Give it up
Gotta give it up

Tell me if I'm so wrong
Where does love come from
If you've sold your reasoning out

Or tell me if I'm so wrong
Where does luck come from
When you've never been without

Can do it
You can do it
You can do it
Gotta give up

<strong>It's My Life</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_12">57:13</a>)

Funny, how I find myself in love with you?
If I could buy my reasoning, I'd pay to lose
One half won't do, I've asked myself
How much do you commit yourself?

It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends
(It never ends)

Funny, how I blind myself, I never knew?
If I was sometimes played upon, afraid to lose
I'd tell myself what good you do
Convince myself

It's my life
Don't you forget
It's my life
It never ends
(It never ends)

I've asked myself
How much do you commit yourself?

It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends

It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends

It's my life
Don't you forget
Caught in the crowd
It never ends

<strong>I Don't Believe in You</strong>  (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_13">1:04:47</a>) 

Now the fun is over
Where do words begin
I'm trying to find the path ahead
Any way you say it
The charade goes on
But your eyes won't see it
It's the same old song

I don't believe you
I don't believe you

Promises so golden
Years have proved them wrong
I'm trying to leave some self respect
Any way you say it
Our decline goes on
But your pride won't heed it
It's the same old song

I don't believe you
I don't believe you
I don't, I don't believe in you

And the way you play it
Is the way you want
Any way you sing it
It's the same old song

I don't believe you
I don't believe you
I don't believe you
I don't believe you

<strong>Such a Shame</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_14">1:10:09</a>)

Such a shame to believe in escape
A life on every face
And that's a change
'Til I'm finally left with an eight
Tell me to relax, I just stare
Maybe I don't know if I should change
A feeling that we share
It's a shame

(Such a shame)
Number me with rage, it's a shame
(Such a shame)
Number me in haste (such a shame)
This eagerness to change
It's a shame

The dice decide my fate
And that's a shame
In these trembling hands
My faith tells me to react, I don't care
Maybe it's unkind that I should change
A feeling that we share
It's a shame

(Such a shame)
Number me with rage, it's a shame
(Such a shame)
Number me in haste (such a shame)
This eagerness to change
Such a shame

Tell me to relax, I just stare
Maybe I don't know if I should change
A feeling that we share
It's a shame

(Such a shame)
Number me with rage, it's a shame
(Such a shame)
Number me in haste
(Such a shame)
Write it across my name, it's a shame
(Such a shame)
Number me in haste (such a shame)
This eagerness to change

Such a shame

<strong>Renée</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_15">1:18:40</a>)

Well, baby how the weeks fade
Baby, was the best part of your youth a sensation
Yeah, that's a change
I never thought I'd end up fooling you

Do you hear what they say?
All these people living up in my street
Well they say
"Out of touch, she lives in faded dreams"

Renee, Renee, Renee, Renee
Baby, how the weeks fade
Baby, how the streets change
Renee, Renee, Renee, Renee
Baby, how the weeks fade

And maybe when the cheat plays
Maybe when the ace falls from his suit
And he tells you
"Yeah, that's the game, I didn't want to lose it on the two"

You're playing his way
But the prize that you've been losing was youth
And I say, "Throw the ace and face up to the truth"

Renee, Renee, Renee, Renee
Baby, how the weeks fade
Baby, how the streets change
Renee, Renee, Renee, Renee
But baby, how the weeks fade

Renee, Renee, Renee, Renee
Baby, how the weeks fade
Baby, how the streets change
Renee, Renee, Renee, Renee
But baby, as the weeks change

And we've seen quite a few
I don't know who's fooling who
I'm fooling you, I'm fooling you
