<center><pre>
Looking from a window above 
It's like a story of love 
Can you hear me 
Came back only yesterday 
I'm moving further away 
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name 
When it's only a game 
And I need you 
Listen to the words that you say 
It's getting harder to stay 
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you

All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you

This is going to take a long time 
And I wonder what's mine 
Can't take no more 
Wonder if you'll understand 
It's just the touch of your hand 
Behind a closed door

All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you

All I needed was the love you gave 
All I needed for another day 
And all I ever knew 
Only you
