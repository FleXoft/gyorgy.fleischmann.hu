Well baby how the weeks fade
Baby was the best part of your youth a sensation
Yeah that's a change
I never thought I'd end up fooling you

Do you hear what they say?
All these people living up in my street
Well they say
'Out of touch, she lives in faded dreams'

Renée Renée Renée Renée
Baby how the weeks fade
Baby how the streets change
Renée Renée Renée Renée
Baby how the weeks fade

And maybe when the cheat plays
Maybe when the ace falls from his suit
And he tells you
'Yeah that's the game, I didn't want to lose it on the two'

You're playing his way
But the prize that you've been losing was youth
And I say
'Throw the ace and face up to the truth'

Renée Renée Renée Renée
Baby how the weeks fade
Baby how the streets change
Renée Renée Renée Renée
But baby how the weeks fade

Renée Renée Renée Renée
Baby how the weeks fade
Baby how the streets change
Renée Renée Renée Renée

But baby as the weeks change
And we've seen quite a few
I don't know who's fooling who
I'm fooling you
