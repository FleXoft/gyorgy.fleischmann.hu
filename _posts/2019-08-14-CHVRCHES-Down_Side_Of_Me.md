Maybe I
Tell you that it's no big deal
Maybe I can aim this high
Or maybe I could eat my words
You're not same, not the same, you're not the same
Not the same, you're not the same, not the same
You're not same, not the same

I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And I hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
And never do what I used to

Maybe you
Could tell 'em that you stayed the course
Maybe I could tear my view
Or maybe I should eat my words

You're not same, not the same, you're not the same
Not the same, you're not the same, not the same
You're not same, not the same

I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And I hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
And never do what I used to
And never do what I used to

Keep you away from the down side of me
You can keep me a drip of the light that you see
I believe that you're all that you said you would be
If I keep you away from the down side of me
You can keep me a drip of the light that you see (only if I could see)
I believe that you're all that you said you would be (only if you could see)

If I keep you away from the down side of me (Only if I could see)
You can keep me a drip of the light that you see (Only if I could see)
I believe that you're all that you said you would be (Only if I could see)

If I keep you away from the down side of me (Only if I could see)
You can keep me a drip of the light that you see (Only if I could see)
I believe that you're all that you said you would be (Only if I could see)

You can wrap up your hopes and release them to me (Only if I could see)
You can keep me a drip of the light that you see (Only if I could see)
I'll believe that you're all that you said you would be
You would be
You would be
You would be

I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And I hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
All I see

And I believe, I believe
And tell myself to think forward
I will show I believe
And I hold you up and know that you're all I see in the light
And never do what I used to
And never do what I used to
