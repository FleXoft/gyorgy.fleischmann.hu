It's not true, tell me I've been lied to
Cryin' isn't like you
Oh, oh, oh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through
Oh, oh, oh
Mmmmm

Maybe won't you take it back
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you
And I don't want to

Oh, oh, oh

Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
I, i, i
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
I didn't mean to make you cry
I, i, i

Maybe won't you take it back
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you
And I don't want to
Oh, oh, oh

The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying

We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to
But I love you
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
