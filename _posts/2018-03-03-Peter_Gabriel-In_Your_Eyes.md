<center><pre>
Accepting all I've done and said
I want to stand and stare again
'Till there's nothing left out
Oh, it remains there in your eyes
Whatever comes and goes
I will hear your silent call

And I will touch this tender wall
'Till I know I'm home again

In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes

Love
I get so lost sometimes
Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away
I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go
I come back to the place you are

And all my instincts
They return
And the grand facade
So soon will burn
Without a noise
Without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes
The light, the heat
In your eyes
I am complete
In your eyes
The resolution
In your eyes
Of all the fruitless searches In your eyes
Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes
I want to be that complete
In your eyes
I want to touch the light, the heat
I see in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes

Love
I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away
I get so tired of working so hard for our survival
I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive

And all my instincts
They return
And the grand facade
So soon will burn
Without a noise
Without my pride
I reach out from the inside

In your eyes
The light, the heat
In your eyes
I am complete
In your eyes
I see the doorway In your eyes
To a thousand churches
In your eyes
The resolution In your eyes
Of all the fruitless searches
In your eyes
Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I want to be that complete
In your eyes
I want to touch the light
The heat I see in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes

Accepting all I've done and said
I want to stand and stare again
'Till there's nothing left out
Oh, it remains there in your eyes
Whatever comes and goes
Oh, it's in your eyes

In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes

I want to stand and stare again
Oh, it's in your eyes
