<p><strong>Another Day in America</strong></p>
<p>And so finally, here we are at the beginning of a whole new era.<br />
The start of a brand new world.  And now what?  How do we start?<br />
How do we begin again?</p>
<p>There are some things you can simply look up--<br />
Such as the size of Greenland, the dates of the famous nineteenth-century rubber wars,<br />
Persian adjectives, the composition of snow.<br />
And other things you just have to guess at.</p>
<p>And then again today is the day and those were the days and now these are the days.<br />
And now the clock points histrionically to noon.  Some new kind of north.<br />
And so, which way do we go?</p>
<p>What are days for?  To wake us up.<br />
To put between the endless nights.</p>
<p>And by the way here's my theory of punctuation.  Instead of a period<br />
at the end of each sentence there should be a tiny clock that shows<br />
how long it took you to write that sentence.</p>
<p>And another way to look at time is this: There was an old married<br />
couple and they had always hated each other.  Never been able to stand<br />
the sight of each other really.  And when they were in their nineties<br />
they finally got divorced and people said: Why did you wait so long?<br />
Why didn't you do this a whole lot earlier?  And they said: Well, we<br />
wanted to wait until the children died.</p>
<p>Ah America!  And yes that will be America.  A whole new place just<br />
waiting to happen.  Broken up parking lots, rotten dumps, speedballs,<br />
accidents and hesitations, things left behind, Styrofoam, computer<br />
chips.</p>
<p>And Jim and John, oh they were there.  And Carol too, her hair pinned<br />
up in that weird beehive way she loved so much.  And Craig and Phil<br />
moving at the pace of summer.  And Uncle Al who screamed all night in<br />
the attic.  Yes something happened to him in the war they said over in<br />
France.  And France had become something we never mentioned.<br />
Something dangerous.</p>
<p>Yes some were sad to see those days disappear.  The flea markets and<br />
their smells, the war, all the old belongings strewn out on the<br />
sidewalks.  Mildewed clothes and old resentments and ragged record<br />
jackets.</p>
<p>And ah these days.  All these days!  What are days for?<br />
To wake us up.  To put between the endless nights.</p>
<p>And meanwhile all over town checks are bouncing and accounts are being<br />
automatically closed.  Passwords are expiring.  And everyone's<br />
counting and comparing and predicting.  Will it be the best of times?<br />
Will it be the worst of times?  Or will it just be another one of<br />
those times?  Show of hands please!</p>
<p>And ah this world which like Kierkegaard said can only be understood<br />
when lived backwards which would entail an incredible amount of<br />
planning and confusion.</p>
<p>And then there are those big questions always at the back of your<br />
mind.  Things like: Are those two people over there actually my real<br />
parents?  Should I get a second Prius?  And you, you who can be silent<br />
in four languages.</p>
<p>Your silence will be considered your consent.</p>
<p>Ah but those were the days before the audience and what the audience<br />
wanted.  And what the audience said it wanted.</p>
<p>And you know the reason I really love the stars is that we cannot hurt  them.<br />
We can't burn them or melt them or make them overflow.<br />
We can't flood them or blow them up or turn them out.<br />
But we are reaching for them.  We are reaching for them.</p>
<p>Some say our empire is passing.  As all empires do.<br />
And others haven't a clue what time it is or where it goes or even  where the clock is.</p>
<p>And oh the majesty of trees.  An unstoppable train.  Different colored wonderlands.<br />
Freedom of speech and sex with strangers.</p>
<p>Dear old God, may I call you old?  And may I ask: Who are these<br />
people?  Ah America!  We saw it.  We tipped it over and then we sold<br />
it.  These are the things I whisper softly to my dolls, those<br />
heartless little thugs dressed in calico kilts and jaunty hats and<br />
their perpetual white toothy smiles.</p>
<p>And oh my brothers and oh my sisters.  What are days for?  Days are where we live.<br />
The flow and then the flow.  They come, they fade, they go and they go.<br />
No way to know exactly when they start or when their time is up.</p>
<p>Oh, another day, another dime.  Another day in America.<br />
Another day, another dollar.  Another day in America.</p>
<p>And oh my brothers and oh my long lost sisters.<br />
How do we begin again?  How do we begin?</p>
