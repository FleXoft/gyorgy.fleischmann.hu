<strong>Waterfall</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_1">0:37</a>)

There's something about them
The troubled eyes
Mister soulmate

Breath in for the last time
Breath in for the last time

You think you are the only one
To reach for the surface
Finding the current

Breathe out for the last time
Breathe out for the last time
Breathe out for the last time

Buried in a waterfall
Inhaling water
Pushed against the water
Buried in a waterfall

Held in for so long
As long as you could
Eyes slowly fading
You are running out of time
You are running out of time
You ran out of time

Buried in a waterfall
Inhaling water
Pushed against the water
Buried in a waterfall

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
No, you're not the only one
You're not the only one
No, you're not the only one!

Buried in a waterfall
Inhaling water
Pushed against the water
Buried in a waterfall
Buried in a waterfall

<strong>Við Vökum</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_2">6:25</a>)

Komdu, komdu fljótt
Uppi í fjalli
Heyrast drunur
Undir rúmmi
Saman tvö
Aldar versti vetrargaddur

Systir ekki sofna
Þá munt þú
Sofa svefninn langa
Segðu, segðu sögu
Um lönd í fjarska
Og perlusanda

<strong>If I Was</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_3">11:15</a>)

If I was bold
And did what I wanted
Would there be
Enough left of me
Or fall to my death
If I was brave
And did let go
Would I insist
If I was gallant
Would I stand up
To your tyranny

If I was daring
Lived my life living
Would I live up to your standing

If I was daring
Lived my life living
Would I live up to your standing

If I was daring
Lived my life living
Would I live up to your standing

If I, If I, If I

<strong>Adrift</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_4">14:45</a>)

Find yourself in a strangest place
Don't know where you were and how you came
Everything around you is unreal

So you say goodbye
But don't know where to go

White light
Noise it makes
Terrified I call out
Nothing came
No one
Just an empty hollow
Motionless I lie inside of me
Fearing pain is all I ever feel

White light
Noise it makes
Terrified I call out
Nothing came
No one
Just an empty hollow

<strong>Circles</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_5">20:00</a>)

Starting up a riot
One mans escalation
Turns to something bigger
He was looking for adventure

A man on a mission
To create his illusions
His life lacking substance

Crying for adventure
Looking kind of anxious
Trying for attention
Looking for affection
Lacking his own conscience
Trying for attention
Looking for affection
Lacking his own conscience

A Life that leaves an echo
Something to remember
To follow your own footsteps
You wind up walking in circles

So take my hand we'll follow
Our thirst of wanderlust
I'll guide you through so be strong
So I can hold on fast
You can hold on fast

Looking for affection
Trying for attention
Prying out an answer
Looking for adventure
Finding it in others
Lacking his own conscience

<strong>Before</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_6">25:21</a>)

Your world is a self-delusion
Your gifts are illusions
To always be right
You make it so
And what have you got
To show

Echoes in your head
Your voice everywhere
Still you follow, follow
Others instead
Jump over the edge
No cord no snare
Life time ago just cause he said
A fairytale he told
A rollercoaster ride
It was all a lie just a little white lie

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me how?
What you told me million times before
Million times before

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me how?
What you told me million times before
Million times before

You told me million times before
You told me million times before

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me how?
What you told me million times before
Million times before

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me how?
What you told me million times before
Million times before

<strong>Night and Day</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_7">29:46</a>)

As the air is turning colder
As the light is getting dark
You feel the frost that comes with dawn
As we warm against the flames

I will give you my whole world
And I know it for a fact, you will be mine
'Cause I feel you all the time
Ohh-oh-oh, you will be mine

Ohh-oh-oh
(Will be mine)
Ohh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh
(You will be mine)
Ohh-oh

As we move a little closer
And you're saying all the things that I wanted you to say
With my hand against your face again
Feel the pulse inside your head
Still you don't remember how I wanted us to stay

Keep me safe
Am I not the one you want?

It's a matter of time
Ohh-oh-oh, you will be mine
I feel you all the time
Ohh-oh-oh, she will be mine
(She will be mine)
She will be mine

Hands down, I'll give you my whole world
Hands down, I'll give you my whole world
Hands down, I'll give you my whole world

You keep me safe
Am I not the one you want? Oh no
What does she crave?
She doesn't want me at all

Ohh-oh-oh
(Will be mine)
Ohh-oh-oh
It's a matter of time
Ohh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh, she will be mine
Ohh-oh-oh
I feel you all the time
Ohh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh, she will be mine
(You will be mine)
Ohh-oh-oh
She will be mine

Ohh-oh-oh
(You will be mine)
Ohh-oh
