<b>Selfoss</b> (00:05)

(Instrumental)

<b>Arabian Horse</b> (05:33)

Disappear, in to the dust
Lost on your horse
Blown away, by your gust
Lost on your horse

Doesn't laugh under the sun
Lost on your horse
Like the brain of sad
Lost in your storm
And the crossroads take a left
Lost on your - horse

Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes

Ridin' on, getting lost
Lost on your horse
Disappear, in to the dust
Lost on your horse
Racing on the desert dunes
I'd chase you like the moon
But when the crossroads take a left
Lost on your - horse

Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright to even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes

Too bright to even see
Too bright to even see
Too bright - too bright
More and more - in my eyes

Too bright too even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright too even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright too even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes
Too bright too even see the sun
More and more sand in my eyes

<b>Over</b> (14:42)

We have made our mistakes over
We have gone up and down over and over

Once again I have crossed, double-crossed over
I betrayed our trust, knocked it all over

Over, over, over, over

And I wonder why, why we didn't try this time
Didn't even try, try to make things right over

(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time) Over
(We didn't even try, try to make things right) Make me
(This time) Over

(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, didn't try this time) Make me over
(We didn't even try, try to make things right) Make me
(This time) Over(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time)
(We didn't even try, try to make things right) We didn't try
(This time) Over

With the wind, this will blow, it will blow over
Is the time, the time to mend over?

Maybe we can delve deep into ourselves over
Find the smallest flame, restart the game over
Over, over, make me over, make me over, over

(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time)
(We didn't even try, try to make things right this time)

(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time) Over
(We didn't even try, try to make things right) Make me
(This time) Over(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, didn't try this time)
Make me over (We didn't even try, try to make things right)
Make me (This time) Over

We didn't try over, over, over, over, over

(As we wonder why, why we didn't try, we didn't try this time)
(We didn't even try, try to make things right this time)
