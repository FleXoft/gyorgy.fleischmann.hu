I'm so lonely on my way
Waiting for a better day
Only one thing left behind -
A world of lust and crime

There's no place for me to hide
I don't know what's wrong or right
Pain and sorrow in my mind
A world of lust and crime

See the wise man in the graveyard
Scream and cry the different story
Lonely people in his own heart
Know the answer just for everything

Love turns a friendly card
With a different story
And a love in your heart
forever
Love is an endless game
You don't have to worry
'cause it's easy to play

There's a chance for me and you
Making all our dreams come true
Trust in love and you won't find
A world of lust and crime

See the wise man in the graveyard
Scream and cry the different story
Lonely people in his own heart
Know the answer just for everything

Love turns a friendly card
With a different story
And a love in your heart
forever
Love is an endless game
You don't have to worry
'cause it's easy to play

See the wise man in the graveyard
Scream and cry the different story
Lonely people in his own heart
Know the light of hope and glory
