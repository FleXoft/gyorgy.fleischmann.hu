Brucie dreams life's a highway
Too many roads bypass my way
Or they never begin
Innocence coming to grief
At the hands of life - stinkin car thief
That's my concept of sin
Does heaven wait all heavenly
Over the next horizon?

But look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt more much more than cars and girls
Just look at us now, start counting
What adds up the way it did when we were young?
Look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt much more than cars and girls

Life's a drive through a dust bowl
What's it do, do to a young soul
We are deeply concerned
Someone stops for directions
Something responds deep in our engines
We have all been burned
Will heaven wait all heavenly
Over the next horizon?

But look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt more much more than cars and girls
Just look at us now, start counting
What adds up the way it did when we were young?
Look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt much more than cars and girls

Little boy got a hot rod
Thinks it makes him some kind of new god
Well this is one race he won't win
'Cause life's no cruise with a cool chick
Too many folks feelin' car sick
But it never pulls in
Brucies thoughts, pretty streamers
Guess this world needs its dreamers
May they never wake up

But look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt more much more than cars and girls
Just look at us now, start counting
What adds up the way it did when we were young?
Look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt much more than cars and girls

But look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt more much more than cars and girls
Just look at us now, start counting
What adds up the way it did when we were young?
Look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt much more than cars and girls
