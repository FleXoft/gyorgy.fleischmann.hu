I see you
You see me
How pleasant
This feeling
 
The moment
You hold me
I missed you
I'm sorry
 
I've given
What I have
I showed you
I'm growing
 
The ashes
Fall slowly
As your voice
Consoles me
 
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

We're swaying
To drum beats
In motion
I'm feeling
 
My patience
Controlling
The question
I won't speak
 
We're telling
The stories
Our laughter
He knows me
 
We're leaving
We're talking
You're closer
It's calming
 
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know

The night will hold us close 
and the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment, 
we're finally alone
I turn to ask the question, 
so anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, 
in your passion, I was lost
 
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
