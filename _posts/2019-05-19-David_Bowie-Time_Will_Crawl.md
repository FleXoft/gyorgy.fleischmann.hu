I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot and he
He made him fly thru a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl 
Till our mouths run dry
Time will crawl 
Till our feet grow small
Time will crawl 
Till our tails fall off
Time will crawl
till the 21st century lose

I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask came off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl 
and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl 
and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl 
and the streets run red
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl 
and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl 
and our feet grow small
Time will crawl 
and our tails fall off
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl 
and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl 
and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl 
and the streets run red
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose

For the crazy child
We'll give every life
For the crackpot notion
