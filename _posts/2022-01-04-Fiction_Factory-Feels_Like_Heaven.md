Heaven is closer now today
The sound is in my ears
I can't believe the things you say
They echo what I fear
Twisting the bones until they snap
I scream but no one knows
You say I'm familiar, cold to touch
And then you turn and go

Feels like heaven
Feels like heaven

See how we planned for saddened eyes
And tears to pave the way
I fought the fever as I knew
My hair returned to gray
Study your face and fade the frame
Too close for comfort now
We can recall the harmony
That lingered but turned sour


Feels like heaven
Feels like heaven

You wanted all I had to give
See me, I feel, see me, I live
Oh oooh

Feels like heaven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)
Feels like heaven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)
Feels like heaven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)
Feels like heaven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)
Feels like hea-ven (heaven is closer, heaven is closer)
