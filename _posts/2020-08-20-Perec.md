You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies
You're always asking what it's all about, darlin' listen to my replies
You say to me I don't talk enough
But when I do I'm a fool
These times I've spent, I've realized
I'm going to shoot through and leave you

The things, you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things, you say
You're unbelievable (what the fuck?)

You burden me with your problems
By telling me more about mine
I'm always so concerned
With the way you say you've always go to stop to think of us
Being one is more than I ever know
But this time, I realize I'm going to shoot through and leave you

The things, you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things, you say
You're unbelievable (what the fuck?)

Seemingly lastless, don't mean you can ask us
Pushing down the relative, bringing out your higher self
Think of the fine times, pushing down the better few
Instead of bringing out the clues
To what the world and everything you answer to
Brace yourself with the grace of ease
I know this world ain't what it seems (what the fuck? Whoa man!)
It's unbelievable

You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies
You're always asking what it's all about, darlin' listen to my replies
You say to me I don't talk enough
But when I do I'm a fool
These times I've spent, I've realized
I'm going to shoot through and leave you

The things you say<div id="sticky_floating_video_end_B8cucse5DXE"></div>
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things you say
Is for what I love you more
The things you say
Your purple prose just gives you away
The things, you say
You're unbelievable (what the fuck?)

You're so unbelievable! (what the fuck?)

You're unbelievable

It's unbelievable (what the fuck?)

You're unbelievable
