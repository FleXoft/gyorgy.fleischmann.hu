<strong>1. Humming</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_1">0:56</a>)

Closer
No hesitation
Give me
All that you have

'Cause it's been so long, that I can't explain
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong

Naked
My thoughts are creeping
Too late
The show has begun

And it's been so long, that I can't confess
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong

Is it all as it seems?
So unresolved, so unredeemed
If I remain, how will I know?

'Cause it's been so long, that I can't be sure
And it's been so wrong
Right now, so wrong

<strong>2. Cowboys</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_2">7:03</a>)

Did you sweep us far from your feet?
Reset in stone this stark belief?
Salted eyes and a soiled dye
Too many years

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Did you feed us tales of deceit?
Conceal the tongues who need to speak?
Subtle lies and a soiled coin
The truth is sold, the deal is done

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Undefied, no signs of regret
Your swollen pride assumes respect
Talons fly as a last disguise
But no return, the time has come

So don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Oh, if you take these things from me

<strong>3. Over</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_3">10:58</a>)

I can't hold this day anymore
Understand me anymore
To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?

Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over

I can't mold this stage anymore
Recognize me anymore
To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?

Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over

To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?

Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over
Is taking me over

Oh, it's all over, yeah
Oh, it's all over, yeah
Oh, oh oh

<strong>4. Only You</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_4">15:00</a>)

"It's like that"

We suffer every day
What is it for?
These crimes of illusion are fooling us all
And now I am weary and I feel like I do

It's only you who can tear me apart
And it's only you who can turn my wooden heart

The size of our fight
It's just a dream
We've crushed everything I can see
In this morning selfishly
How we've failed and I feel like I do

It's only you, who can tear me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

"It's like that"

Now that we've chosen to take all we can
This shade of autumn
A stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side

And it's only you, who can tear me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart
It's only you, who can tear me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

<strong>5. Seven Months</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_5">20:37</a>)

How can I forget you
Disregard how I feel
Silently listen
To the words I can't see

As long as I have tried
As low as I can be
I will never resign myself
From the trial I seek

Why should I forgive you
After all that I've seen
Quietly whisper
When my heart wants to scream

For as long as I have tried
And as low as I can be
I will never resign myself
From the trial I seek

There's no time to rest
Or to reconsider
For this cruel unsaid
Won't concede

For as long as I have tried
And as low as I can be
I will never resign myself
From the trial I seek

<strong>6. Numb</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_6">25:10</a>)

Unable so lost
I can't find my way
Been searchin' but I have never seen
A turnin', a turnin' from deceit

'Cause a child, roses like
Try to reveal what I could feel

I can't understand myself
Anymore
'Cause I'm still feelin' lonely
Feelin' so unholy

'Cause a child, roses like
Try to reveal what I could feel
I'm lonely
Just won't leave me alone
Ohh, ohh
Yea
Yea
{I think this is right}

I'm foolin' somebody
A faithless path that roam
Deceiving to breath this secretly
The silence, the silence I can't bear

'Cause a child roses like
Tries to reveal what I could feel
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone
Ohh no
And this loneliness
It just won't leave me alone

A lady of war
A lady of war

<strong>7. Undenied</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_7">30:40</a>)

Your softly spoken words
Release my whole desire
Undenied totally

And so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong

Beneath your tender touch
My senses can't divide
Oh so strong my desire

For so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong

Now that I've found you
And seen behind those eyes
How can I carry on

For so bare is my heart
I can't hide
And so where does my heart
Belong

Belong
Belong
Belong

<strong>8. Mysterons</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_8">35:14</a>)

Inside, you're pretending
Crimes have been swept aside
Somewhere
Where they can forget

Divine upper reaches
Still holding on
This ocean
Will not be grasped

All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want

Refuse to surrender
Strung out until ripped apart
Who dares
Who dares to condemn?

All for nothing
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want

<strong>9. Sour Times</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_9">41:00</a>)

To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh, these sour times

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Nobody loves me, it's true, oh, no
Nobody loves me, not like you do, oh
It's just like it seems, only disturbed
Oh, nobody loves me, not like you do

<strong>10. Elysium</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_10">45:00</a>)

No one has said
What the truth should be
And no one decided
That I'd feel this way
If you felt as I
Would you betray yourself?

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me

No one should fear
What they cannot see
And no one's to blame
It's just hypocrisy
It's written in your eyes
And how I despise myself

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me

And it's your heart
That's so wrong
Mistaken
You'll never know
Your feathered sacred self

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
And you can't deny how I feel
Oh, why should you decide for me?

<strong>11. Glory box (!!)</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_11">51:30</a>)

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
I'm gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just...

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room, yeah

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman
I just wanna be a woman

'Cause it's all I wanna be, is all, a woman
For this is the beginning
Of forever and ever
It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
I'm gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be

<strong>12. Roads</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_12">58:17</a>)

Ohh, can't anybody see?
We've got a war to fight here
We've never find our way here
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel, this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong?

Storm, in the mornin' light
I feel, no more can see
Frozen to myself

I got nobody on my side
Surely that ain't right
Surely that ain't right

Ohh, can't anybody see?
We've got a war to fight here
We've never find our way here
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel, this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong?

How can it feel, this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong?

Ohh, can't anybody see?
We've got a war to fight here
We've never find our way here
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel, this wrong?
From this moment
How can it feel, this wrong?

<strong>13. Strangers</strong> (<a class="hvr-buzz-out" id="seekTo_13">1:03:52</a>)

Oh can anybody see the light
Where the morn meets the dew
And the tide rises

Did you realise no one can see inside your view
Did you realise for why this sight belongs to you

Oh just set aside your fears of life
With the sole desire

Done it warning done in now
And that ain't real
On in this side
Done it warning done in now
And that ain't real on in this side

Done it warning done in now
And that ain't real
Done it warning done in now
And that ain't real on in this side

Oh, oh can anybody see the light
Where the morn meets the dew
And the tide rises

Did you realise no one can see inside your view
Did you realise for why this sight belongs to you
