I am the [?]
I feel what I want
Mind, heart, soul
I can figure it out
I wanna get over
Wanna get out of your hands

I take you back
Till the point I take it out
I take it out of your mind
Before [?] things you're trying to hide
Whether it's easy or harder
I'll never give up

I can see the sign
You think I'm an easy target
I won't keep my voice down
I want, I want something I can shout about

I can see the sign
You think I'm an easy target
That's not something I buy
So I'm gonna get out

I can move you
So stay where you are
Feel me cut right through to the quick
Do what I want
Play till they end it again

I take you back
Till the part of final break
Find a way to control
To the edge of the lake
But I don't what you're trying
What you're trying to own
Whether it's easy or harder
I'll never give up

I can see the sign
You think I'm an easy target
That's not something I buy
So I'm gonna get out

I can see the sign
You think I'm so weak and feeble
That's not something I cry about
But I'm gonna get out

I can see in your eyes, ooh
You think I'm so weak and feeble
That's not something I cry about
No, no, no
But I'm gonna get out

I know it's right, ooh
You think I'm some easy girl
I'm not trying to belong
To you or anyone, or anything

[?]

It's not something I cry about
It's not something I cry about
[?]
No, no, no
It's not something I cry about
