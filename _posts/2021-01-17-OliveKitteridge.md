How's Christopher?
He's getting married tomorrow.
You with anyone?
Not anymore.
Was she a nut job?
She had problems.
But I bet you couldn't get enough of her.

You look dead.
Well, I'm not.
Are you a witch?
Yes.
Now, go away before I eat you up.

Well, I was always told not to expect too much.
Well, whoever told you that was wrong.

My wife died in December.
Give me a reason to wake up in the morning.
Don't have a clue.
I'm waiting for the dog to die so I can shoot myself.

You had a normal happy childhood, just for the record.
You need to admit that you say these horrible things to me that make me want to crawl into a hole and die.
Just admit it for fucking once! Admit that you were a horrible mother!

I would have drowned if it weren't for Mrs. Kitteridge.

It baffles me, this world.
