My friends all tell me
What they think that I should do
So much confusion
When it comes to loving you

So many reasons
Why we should stay apart
My mind tells me one thing
Should I listen to my heart?

Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
Wish I knew you better
Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
Should I say no?

We may be different
But there’s one thing that stays the same
I know I need you
In a way that I can’t explain

So many reasons
Why we should stay apart
My mind tells me one thing
Should I listen to my heart?

Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
Wish I knew you better
Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
Should I say no?
