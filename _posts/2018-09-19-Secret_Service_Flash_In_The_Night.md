<center><pre>
As a break of dawn came closer
All my hopes seemed so forlorn.
The misty signs of laughter
And the light eluded all.
My despair was caught in motion
A face just barely true
Shadows in blue.

A flash in the night...

In the changing of the season
Releasing one lost name.
The scar once healed forever
Dissolving in the rain.
A twig snapped in the clearing
A glimpse of golden skin
My face within

A flash in the night...

My despair was caught in motion.
A face just barely true
Shadows in blue.

A flash in the night...
