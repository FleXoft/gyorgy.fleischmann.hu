<center><pre>
Never get angry at the stupid people
Though I go crazy at the dullness of my life
Sit and stare into a dusty window
An empty face stares back at me and cries

My vulnerability rushes up to me
Till I'm left here
The rebel without a cause
The deeper I delve into
The consciousness of me with you
The harder it gets
I need to close my eyes
What hurts me most
I'll never see your eyes again

Though I get weary
Doesn't mean that I'm unwilling
My body belies me I'm of fertile mind
As I grow older
The world forgets me
And talks to me as if I'm some kind of child

Their insensitivity washes over me
Till I'm left here
The rebel without a cause
The deeper I delve into
The consciousness of me and you
The harder it gets
I need to close my eyes
What hurts me most
I'll never see your eyes again

The harder it gets
I need to close my eyes
I can't recollect
I'll never see your eyes again

I try to forget
I'll never see your eyes again
I can't recollect
I'll never see your eyes again
What hurts me most
I'll never see your eyes again

Don't touch me
