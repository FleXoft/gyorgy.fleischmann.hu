<center><pre>
Touch my skin,and tell me what you're thinking
Take my hand and show me where we're going
Lie down next to me, look into my eyes and tell me, oh tell me what you're seeing
So sit on top of the world and tell me how you're feeling
What you feel now, is what I feel for you

Take my hand and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone if I'm lying to you
Take your time and if I'm lying to you
I know you'll find that you believe me
you believe me

See my eyes, they carry your reflection
Watch my lips and hear the words I'm telling you
Give your trust to me and look into my heart and show me, show me what you're doing
So sit on top of the world and tell me how you're feeling
What you feel now is what I feel for you

Take my hand and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone if I'm lying to you
Take your time, if I'm lying to you
I know you'll find that you believe me
you believe me

Feel the sun on your face and tell me what you're thinking
Catch the snow on your tongue and show me how it tastes
Take my hand and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone
if I'm lying to you

Take your time, if I'm lying to you
I know you'll find that you believe me
you believe me
Take my hand and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone if I'm lying to you

Take your time, if I'm lying to you
I know you'll find that you believe me
you believe me
