Sunsets
We wander through a foreign town
Strangely there’s nobody else around
So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground

And when you go away I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear-view
 
Sunsets
I wanna hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan’s book covers that we both adored…
  
When you go away I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear-view

This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days

When you go away I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear-view

When you go away I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear-view
